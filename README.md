#### Degrees
- [Degrees project](./degrees)


Based on the "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" which states that any hollywood actor
can be connected to Kevin Bacon within a chain of six movies.

This project finds the shortest path between two actor of a data base, and the
condition is that they have to be connected in between by Kevin Bacon.

This implementents a BFS search algorithm which is suitable for cases where the
shortest path is key

#### Tic-Tac-Toe
- [Tic-Tac-Toe project](./tictactoe)


Implements a minimax algorithm to play the classic
Tic-Tac-Toe game against an AI.

The minimax algorithm has no depth limit because the game does not have many
branches


## Lecture 1 - Knowledge
Knowledge based algorithms based on propositional logic as well as first
order logic
#### Realted problem sets
- Knights
- Minesweeper

## Numpy multidimensional arrays
For a 3D numpy array we must provide 3 indexes, for example "x, y, z", the
logic in the structure of the array is as follows:
 - x = layers, pages, etc of the 3d array
 - y = number of rows in each layer, page...
 - z = number of columns in each layer, page...

Do not forget that Numpy follows the "C" ordering convention
